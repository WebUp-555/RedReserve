RedReserve is a web-based Blood Donation and Request Management System developed to demonstrate how blood banks can efficiently manage donors, blood requests, and inventory through a centralized platform. The system consists of an Admin (blood bank authority) and two types of clients—Donors who book donation slots and Requesters who request blood based on availability. It uses a Node.js and Express server to handle RESTful APIs, MongoDB for managing dynamic blood data, JWT-based authentication for secure access, and Postman for API testing. All data used in the project is dummy data created solely for academic demonstration purposes.
